# Code Resources
> Resources for learning programming languages and dev tools

A dev encyclopedia quick reference - including 

- Definitions
- Links to the homepage, tutorials and docs
- Links to installation guides (in my gists or other repos). 

The idea is to focus on **links** to resources, as a quick reference or favorite links or bookmarks, but shared publically. With the aim to reduce friction so I can drop in links and titles in a CMS and not care about styling except at a theme level. 

And **not** to cover detailed paragraphs or actual syntax rules or samples (except maybe for Hello World)
