# Code Resources
> Resources for learning programming languages and dev tools

A dev encyclopedia quick reference - including 

- definitions
- links to the homepage, tutorials and docs
- links to installation guides (in my gists or other repos). 

The idea is to focus on **links** to resources, as a quick reference or favorite links or bookmarks, but shared publically. 

And **not** to cover detailed paragraphs or actual syntax rules or samples (except maybe for Hello World)
