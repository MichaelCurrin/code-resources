### CloudFare vs CloudFare Pages

The core service at [CloudFlare.com](https://cloudflare.com/) gives you a CDN and WAF (Web Application Firewall) on top of your existing application, to give performance and protection. 

While CloudFare Pages service is CD/CD - it actually deploys and hosts your static site - such as one build with Jekyll (static site) or Node + React (as a Single-Page Application).
