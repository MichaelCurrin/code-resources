          Actions are completely free for every open-source repository and include **2000 free build minutes per month** for all your private repositories which is comparable with most CI/CD free plans. If that is not enough for your needs you can pick another plan or go the self-hosted route.

        url: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#usage-limits
        description: On the free tier you can have _20 concurrent jobs_. I guess 20 on one repo or 20 repos with one each.
