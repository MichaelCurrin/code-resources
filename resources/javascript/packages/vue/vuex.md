### What does Vuex do?

> Vuex helps us deal with shared state management with the cost of more concepts and boilerplate. It's a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.

### Do I need Vuex?

> ...if your app is simple, you will most likely be fine without Vuex. 
> 
> A simple store pattern may be all you need.

See [Simple State Management from Scratch](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/state-management.html#simple-state-management-from-scratch) on the standard Vue docs.

The docs also say that might run into use-cases in a medium to large app where you need to manage state better. And then Vuex is a natural step there. Don't add it just for the sake of it.

From the author of Redux:

> Flux libraries are like glasses: youâ€™ll know when you need them.

The Redux author also said that you probably don't need Redux.
