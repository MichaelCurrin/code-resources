# Paradigms

There over 200 programs so I wouldn't cover them all here.


## Functional Programming

See [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) on Wikipedia.

See [Top 13 Functional Programming Languages](https://purelyfunctional.tv/functional-programming-languages/) list. It provides a summary and links for each.

- Elm - [homepage](https://elm-lang.org/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(programming_language)) - generates JS I think.
- Erlang
- Elixir (superset of Elrang)
- Lisp
- Closure (Dialect of Lisp) and ClosureScript (for generating JS). Unlike other Lisp dialects, Clojure runs on the Java platform and is compiled to JVM bytecode. 
- Haskell
- OCaml
- [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/)
    > Reason lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems.
- Common Lisp
- Standard ML
- Scala
- Rust
- F#
- Scala
- Racket
- Kotlin
- Swift
- PureScript - compiles to JS.


## Object-Oriented Programming

- Java - _everything_ is a class.


## Mixed

- JavaScript
- Python
- Go - see [post](https://flaviocopes.com/golang-is-go-object-oriented/)
