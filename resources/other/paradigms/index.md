# Comparison of Paradigms

In this section of pages, I cover definitions of paradigms and links to learn more. For some areas I also cover languages that focus on enable that paradigm.

There over 200 programs so I wouldn't cover them all here.


## Overview

Based on [Comparison of Programming Paradigms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms) on Wikipedia.

### Approaches 

There are two main approaches to programming:

- Imperative programming – focuses on **how** to execute, defines control flow as statements that change a **program state**.
- Declarative programming – focuses on **what** to execute, defines program logic, but not detailed control flow.

### Paradigms

The following are widely considered the main programming paradigms, as seen when measuring programming language popularity:

- Procedural programming, structured programming – specifies the **steps** a program must take to reach a **desired state**.
- Functional programming – treats programs as evaluating **mathematical functions**. Avoids state and mutable data.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) – organizes programs as objects: data structures consisting of datafields and methods together with their interactions.

### Approaches and Paradigms

From [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM).

Paradigm | Approach | Description 
---      | ---      | ---
Procedural | Imperative | The default style.
Procedural | Functional | Minimize state.
OOP | Imperative | Segregate state.

Or you can mix OOP and FP - do both paradigms in one project in different modules or even in the same.
