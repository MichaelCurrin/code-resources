# Paradigms

See [Comparison of Programming Paradigms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms) on Wikipedia.

In this section I cover definitions of paradigms and links to learn more. For some areas I also cover languages that focus on enable that paradigm.
There over 200 programs so I wouldn't cover them all here.




## Mixed Functional and Object-Orientated

These languages let you do either FP, or OOP, or both.

- JavaScript - supports classes for OOP and map/reduce/filter and higher-order functions for FP.
- Python
- Go - see [post](https://flaviocopes.com/golang-is-go-object-oriented/). Go doesn't have classes but it does have receivers. Though don't have to have to use them for the sake of it and they may limit your code (associating a function with a receiver makes the function less reusable).
