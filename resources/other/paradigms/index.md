# Paradigms

See [Comparison of Programming Paradigms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms) on Wikipedia.

In this section I cover definitions of paradigms and links to learn more. For some areas I also cover languages that focus on enable that paradigm.

There over 200 programs so I wouldn't cover them all here.
