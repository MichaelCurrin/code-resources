# Mixed Functional and Object-Orientated

These languages let you do either FP, or OOP, or a mixure of both.

- JavaScript - supports classes for OOP and map/reduce/filter and higher-order functions for FP.
- Python
- Go - see [post](https://flaviocopes.com/golang-is-go-object-oriented/). Go doesn't have classes but it does have receivers. Though don't have to have to use them for the sake of it and they may limit your code (associating a function with a receiver makes the function less reusable).
