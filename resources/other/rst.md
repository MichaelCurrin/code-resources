This section is a brief introduction to reStructuredText (reST) concepts and syntax, intended to provide authors with enough information to author documents productively. Since reST was designed to be a simple, unobtrusive markup language, this will not take too long.

## What is it?

> reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system. 
> 
> It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. 
> 
> reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific application domains...


## What is it for?

> The primary goal of reStructuredText is to define and implement a **markup syntax** for use in Python docstrings and other documentation domains, that is readable and simple, yet powerful enough for non-trivial use. 
> 
> The intended purpose of the markup is the conversion of reStructuredText documents into useful structured data formats.
