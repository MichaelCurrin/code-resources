Note that your repo _already_ has a Contributors section on the right of the main view.

This GitHub integration which lets you talk to the bot on a PR and it will update a contributor list at the bottom of your `README.md` with their user details. This also reflects in a count at the top of your `README.md`.

Example:

```
@all-contributors please add @jakebolam for infrastructure, tests and code
```

Enable it at the GitHub account settings level, for selected repos or all repos.
