I have a couple of examples of requests as gists - see my [Gist viewer](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/gist-viewer/).

See my [GitHub GraphQL](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/github-graphql-tool) tool written in Python. In particular, see the [queries](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/github-graphql-tool/tree/master/ghgql/queries) directory.
