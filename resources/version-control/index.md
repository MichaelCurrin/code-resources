### About

This topic is about that tools are used to manage a codebase in source control. A codebase is human-written code for an application which can be used to deploy and instance of the application such as to production or development environments.

[Subversion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)), Git and [Mercurial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial) are examples of popular version control systems.

### Source Control vs. Version Control

These two terms are usually used interchangeably.

[Source control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control) is specific to source code in text files. While [Version control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) is more general and also includes binary files (e.g. executables) and digital assets (e.g. images).
