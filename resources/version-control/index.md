### About

These tools are used to manage a codebase in source control. A codebase is human-written code for an application which can be used to deploy and instance of the application such as to production or development environments.

[Subversion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)), Git and [Mercurial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial) are examples of popular version control systems. 

### Source Control vs. Version Control

These two terms are usually used interchangeably. 

Source control is specific to source code in text files. While version control includes binary files (e.g. executables) and digital assets (e.g. images).
